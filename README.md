# AImi
## Lore
Aimi Yamamoto, born in 1996 in a small Japanese village, has longed to be a broadcaster since childhood.
With her unique voice and natural talent, she gained a YouTube following and eventually signed with a J-Pop agency.
Her star rose quickly, but the pressures of show business and an unhealthy lifestyle led her to a physical collapse.
After her death, fans "revived" her as a robot with artificial intelligence thanks to modern technology,
but her mechanical form lost emotional depth. Eventually, her voice became part of UTAU as a digital voice bank,
allowing her legacy to continue through AI tools.
